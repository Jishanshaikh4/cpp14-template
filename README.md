# cpp14-template
A general code template for programming contests with implementations of most used functions such as gcd, etc.

## Why use template?
- For faster execution of code (Faster versions of std::cin and std::cout)
- Less time waste on easier portion of problem; easier focus on hard problems
- It's nice to be organized
